1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
A:   No, I would not be able to use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because although I would like to see if the packages have been transported properly to the other end of the user who was sent that respective message, unit testing is meant to small-scale testing of inputs and outputs so it may be tedious to do since we want to make sure that the other party has received the message and process of encryption and decryption for privacy protection purposes may be too large of a process to be tested in 1 unit test. It is just essential to test all parts of your feature to ensure their functionality in general but unit testing may not be enough since it is smaller components, not the entire purpose of the app to be testable in unit testing alone.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
A:   Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because I would like to see if the max length constraint is being followed or if the message is being cut short or entirely not delivered when the max is reached or not accepting any more input after max is reached. It is important to check that the feature is doing what it is intended to so I woll test both cases as much as possible.
