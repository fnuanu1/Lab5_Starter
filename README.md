1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
A:   Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because I would like to see if the packages have been transported properly to the other end of the user who was sent that respective message. It is just essential to test all parts of your feature to ensure their functionality.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
A:   Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because I would like to see if the max length constraint is being followed or if the message is being cut short or entirely not delivered when the max is reached or not accepting any more input after max is reached. It is important to check that the feature is doing what it is intended to so I woll test both cases as much as possible.
